"""ReviewRouterPort: the boundary that routes an escalated market brief to Hrz7 (rule R8).

Every market brief is consequential strategy input and always requires human review (maker-
checker, P-06): the agent is the maker, a qualified strategist is the checker. Rule R8 says a
producer that sets ``requires_human_review`` MUST route the item to the Hrz7 Human-Review &
Maker-Checker Console rather than terminate the escalation in a per-repo boolean. This port is
that hand-off. The domain stays pure: the adapter (not this port) depends on the shared
``review-kit`` client and does the S2S submission.
